# My Core Value

>  50 years later, when I look back upon what I’ve done, what are the things that really matter?

Sustainability
- Long-term thinkingㄡ
- Sustainability outweighs unsustainable growth.
- The more diverse a network, the greater its ability to respond to change. 
- Subtle unsustainable decisions will eventually add up and crash the system.

As a Human Being
- Every person deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life.
- Learning to stand in somebody else's shoes to see through their eyes, that's how peace begins.
- Empathy (同理心) is a quality of character that can change the world - one that makes you understand that your obligations to others extend beyond people who look like you and act like you and live in your neighborhood.

Personal Growth 
- Deep Work
- The power of compound interest 複利的力量
- Stay Hungry. Never be satisfied, and always push yourself. Stay Foolish. Do (or be willing to keep trying) the things people say cannot be done.
- The ability to stay focused is much more crucial than time and money. 與錢與時間相比，專注力是更加至關重要

Relationships with Friends and Family
- Be loyal to my friends 當一個忠誠的朋友
- Be sincere and show appreciation 真誠待人，表示感恩
- Focus on the quality time with people. 
- Family is always there for me no matter how I am. Value and cherish my relationship. 
- In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends.

Aesthetics
- Less is more 少即是多
- Aesthetics in different aspects of daily life 實踐生活之美

Miscellaneous
- Stay healthy 健康大於一切
- Pay attention to details 魔鬼藏在細節中
- Pareto principle: For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes.
- Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.
- 10X Is Easier Than 10 Percent
