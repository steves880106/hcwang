## Intermittent fasting 

Fasting has been a practice throughout human evolution. Ancient hunter-gatherers didn’t have supermarkets, refrigerators or food available year-round. Sometimes they couldn’t find anything to eat. As a result, humans evolved to be able to function without food for extended periods of time.


### Benifits of Intermittent fasting
- By making you eat fewer meals, intermittent fasting can lead to an automatic reduction in calorie intake.


- The levels of **human growth hormone** skyrocket, increasing as much as 5-fold. This has benefits for fat loss and muscle gain, to name a few.


- **Insulin sensitivity** improves and levels of insulin drop dramatically. Lower insulin levels make stored body fat more accessible.


- Intermittent fasting can reduce insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar by 3–6% and fasting insulin levels by 20–31%, which should protect against type-II diabetes.


- Reductions in markers of inflammation, a key driver of many chronic diseases.
- Intermittent fasting may reduce LDL cholesterol, blood triglycerides, inflammatory markers, blood sugar and insulin resistance — all risk factors for heart disease.


- Intermittent fasting increases the brain hormone BDNF and may aid the growth of new nerve cells. It protects against Alzheimer’s disease.


- When fasted, cells initiate cellular repair processes. This includes autophagy, where cells digest and remove old and dysfunctional proteins that build up inside cells.


### Action Items
- Adopt 16:8 style, weekday fasting from 8 PM– 12 PM
- Unsweeten tea and coffee are allowed during fasting
