## Philosophy: One Guest At A Time  
by Thomas Keller

> In the end, a great meal is not about the food and wine. A great meal is an emotional experience. We try to make it an extraordinary one by establishing a beautiful place, one filled with a staff that cares about it as they do about their home, where we treat one guest at a time.

> It's with this approach that we care for you, and you become the central focus of your experience. Our chefs are meticulous about culinary details, fundamental techniques and a kitchen that delivers the very best products of the earth to the table. No detail or element can be less important or more important than another. 

> A great meal is not one that just fills you up. A great meal is a journey that returns you to sources of pleasure you may have forgotten and takes you to places you havenâ€™t been before.

> When you acknowledge, as you must, that there is no such thing as perfect food, only the idea of it, then the real purpose of striving toward perfection becomes clear: TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY, THAT IS WHAT COOKING IS ALL ABOUT.
