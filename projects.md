# Personal Projects

> Video Inference - Specialization & Parallelization with Tensorflow Serving
- Made NoScope (an inference time optimized system) more scalable by designing a new architecture and deploying its different components in distributed settings with TensorFlow Serving
- Implemented the client-side in asynchronous and multiprocess fashion to send requests to servers efficiently.

> Pottery Atlas: Knowledge Base Construction
- Extended Fondeur, a knowledge base construction engine for richly formatted data based on Snorkel, to support visual information extraction from diagrams and provide multimodal (Text and images) entity resolution methods.
