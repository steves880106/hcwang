Serious and meaningful relationship

## When I was single, did I love myself?
- One strategy: Focus on creating a full life now, for myself, rather than finding a partner.

## During the relationship, do we/I:
- have meaningful conversation and enjoy quality time
- show appreciation and be humble
- learn, grow and face all kinds of weather together
- share the same long-term goals
- be honest to ourselves
- give each other space for personal development
- build trust between each other
