- Built a single page application (SPA) in React / Redux / SCSS using a toolchain including Npm / Webpack / Babel.
- Created a common components library with  Block-Element-Modifier methodology.
- Improved p95 of a front end application by React code splitting and Webpack tree shaking.
- Designed the color branding solution for different clients by white-labeling components and dynamically loading overwriting stylesheets.
- Built reusable system monitoring dashboards, set up actionable alerts, created customized metrics with Datadog.
- Identified our gaps from Continuous Integration (CI)  to Continuous Delivery (CD), initiated cross-team cooperation such as creating missing functionalities in Jenkins pipeline library, enhancing regression/performance test coverage and adding post-production-deployment smoke tests and monitoring. Eventually brought out the first CD pipeline at Rally.
- Automated the Avro schema generation, registration, versioning process for the events routed through the Kafka clusters.
- Adopted HashiCorp Vault as our secret management solution, which allows for managing key/value pairs, encryption-as-a-service and fine-grained audit logging.
- Integrated the net promoter score service with Salesforce and Qualtrics to collect customer insights.
- Designed a fault-tolerant at-rest key rotation system to re-encrypt billions of records with PHI/PII in MongoDB.
- Adopted Amplitude to track UI interaction events to enable further analysis such as funnel analysis and behavioral cohorting.
- Designed the cutover strategy  from Mesos to Kubernetes for our microservices to make sure that communication among services is still available during/after the transition.
- Set up RabbitMQ message queues to route events to/from other microservices.
- Lead the effort to upgrade the mongodb driver so that our services are able to support higher versions of MongoDB.
- Utilized Snyk in our CD pipeline for dependency and container scanning to ensure security.

**Software Engineer Intern**. 

> Created an end-to-end solution for mobile applications to log data to Splunk, gives developers ability to correlate errors stemming from mobile to the actual server logs associated with them, works include:
- Built a microservice to provide apis for posting error logs, customized encrypted logs and configured them in the API gateway.
- Created a library in React Native for posting customized secured logs & getting custom support code.
