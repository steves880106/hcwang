## Rally Health 
05.2018 ~ Current San Francisco, CA, United States

**Software Engineer II**  
Designed systems with stringent correctness, scalability and long-term maintainability to put healthcare in hand of millions of members.
### Monitoring Initiative
- Devised an end-to-end solution for mobile applications to log data to Splunk, gives developers the ability to correlate errors stemming from mobile to the actual server logs:
  - Built a brand new microservice with Play Framework and Scala to provide APIs for posting error logs, customized encrypted logs, and configured them in the API gateway.
  - Created a PoC with  React Native for posting customized secured logs & getting custom support code in United Healthcare Mobile App.
- Formulated customized metrics, set up actionable alerts and crafted reusable system monitoring dashboards with Datadog.

### Performance (p95)  Initiative
- Lead the effort to upgrade the MongoDB driver and adopt WeePickle, an efficient Scala serialization system. The DB operation Read/Write Response Time (p95) of our services is improved by 27%.
- Improved virtual page load time (p95) of a SPA by React code splitting and Webpack tree shaking by 80%.
- Redesigned the UI application and API discovery mechanism by reducing external traffic routing within SPAs and edge  services, and significantly reduced the initial page load time (p95) of SPAs by 30%

### CI/CD Initiative
- Pioneered in the journey from Continuous Integration (CI) to Continuous Delivery (CD) at Rally.  First identified our gaps from CI to CD and initiated cross-team cooperation to 1)  create missing functionalities in Jenkins pipeline library, 2) utilize Snyk for dependency and container scanning to ensure security, 3) enhance regression/performance test coverage, and 4) add post-production-deployment smoke tests and monitoring.

### Security Initiative
- Established a fault-tolerant at-rest key rotation system with RabbitMQ/ Actor System  to asynchronously re-encrypt billions of records with PHI/PII in MongoDB without sacrificing microservices performance and ensuring the data safety from 50 millions of members.
